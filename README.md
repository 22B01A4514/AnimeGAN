# AnimeGAN

AnimeGAN is a deep learning project designed to generate anime-style images using a custom dataset and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

## Overview

This project leverages a GAN architecture to train a model capable of creating new anime character images. The generator network is trained to produce realistic visuals, while the discriminator learns to distinguish generated images from real ones, pushing the generator toward more convincing outputs.

## Features

- Custom dataset of anime character images
- Generator and discriminator designed using PyTorch
- Trains a GAN from scratch with anime-specific data
- Outputs new, stylized anime-style images

## Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Google Colab (for training and experimentation)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up your environment with required dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)
3. Load or prepare the anime dataset
4. Run the training script and evaluate sample outputs

## Dataset

This project uses a curated dataset of anime images. Make sure you have the dataset prepared and placed in the appropriate directory.

## Future Improvements

- Add style-transfer capabilities
- Train on higher-resolution images
- Include a web-based demo or UI for image generation
